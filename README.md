## Delphi.CpuUsage

Simple class inherited from TTHread, that will get Total CPU usage (as persentage).

If someone wants new features and/or find room for improvement (must be :D ), jsut throw me an pull reguest.

### Ideas/TODO
 - Add event when new CPU usage value after has been calculated
 - Make way to get CPU usage on demand. Maybe...
 - ...
